# Google Search Engine - What? How? Why?

## What?

Google Search Engine is a complex system. What does it do? 

### The Surface

On the surface, Google Search Engine appears to work like this.

>> You specify a query. It finds a list of websites most relevent to your query.

### Deeper

However, when we look at it more deeply, it appears to work like this:

>> You specify a query. It finds a list of websites which you are very likely to click, even if these have nothing to do with your query.

### Reality

But in reality, the Google Search Engine actually works like this:

>> You specify a query. It finds a list of websites, which will maximize Google's revenue in the long term. In other words, it shows you a list of websites that reprogrammes your brain to behave in such a way to maximize Google's revenue.

## How?

Google Search Engine operates on a complex array of technical components and algorithms. Here's a list of important technical components:

1. **Scanning**: Google uses web scanners (bots) to discover webpages. Scanners look at webpages and follow links on those pages, akin to someone going through content on the internet.

2. **Indexing**: Once a webpage is discovered, Google tries to understand what the page is about. This process involves analyzing the content (text, images, video), as well as the date of publication, title, keywords, and other metadata. The information is then stored in Google's index, a huge database.

3. **Ranking Algorithms**: When you perform a search, Google's algorithms look through the index to find relevant information. The most famous algorithm, PageRank, evaluates the quality and quantity of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of the website's importance. The relevancy of content, the context of search queries, user engagement, and freshness of content are other crucial factors.

4. **Search Algorithms and Machine Learning**: Google uses complex algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand and predict user intent. This includes understanding synonyms, the context of search queries, and personalization based on the user's search history.

5. **User Experience and Interface**: The way results are presented, including the layout, design, and interactive elements, is also a key component. This includes features like the Knowledge Graph, featured snippets, and local search results.

6. **Advertising and Monetization**: Google AdWords is a significant aspect, where advertisers bid on certain keywords for their clickable ads to appear in Google's search results. This model aligns with Google's interest in showing relevant ads to users while maximizing long-term revenue.

7. **Privacy and Personalization**: Google uses data like search history, location, and device information to personalize search results. While this improves user experience, it also raises privacy concerns.

8. **Security**: Implementing robust security measures to protect user data and prevent malicious practices is essential.

9. **User Feedback and Quality Testing**: Google often uses human raters to evaluate the quality of search results and to provide feedback for the refinement of algorithms.

10. **Semantic Search Capabilities**: Understanding the meaning behind the words in queries is a critical aspect of modern search engines. Google's ability to interpret context and semantics plays a significant role in delivering accurate results.
