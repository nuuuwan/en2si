# Will AI take your job? 
## Jobs, Tasks and the Future

Jobs consists of many tasks. Hence, for each task in a job, we will ask "Can AI perform this task?"

Let's consider one job. A software engineer job. How AI will affect the many tasks involved in this complex job?

A typical software engineer's tasks:

* Writing computer code (including Debugging, Reviewing, Documenting and Maintaining)
* Reading-up on/Learning New Developments, Best Practices
* Helping/Guiding/Mentoring to colleagues
* Participating in the general software manufacturing process
* Working with colleagues and other teams
* Interacting with users to find what they want, and understand problems that they have
* Providing technical support
* Participating in the software community

To see how AI would affect these tasks, let‚Äôs consider the first task: Writing computer code.

The task of writing code consists of several sub-tasks.

* Problem Task: Identifying or Specifying the Problem that needs to be solved (For example, a computer system for running digital elections)
* Solution Task: Designing the code that solves the problem.
* Verification Task: Making sure that the problem is solved.
* Ownership Task: Being the individual who is responsible the entire system

How might AI affect each of these sub-tasks?

* Problem: At a high level, AI cannot define problems because it has no intent, nor fundamental creativity. AI have no internal needs, unlike humans , nor an intrinsic desire for art or creativity. However, once the high level problem is defined, an AI can define the lower level sub-problems.¬†
* Solution: Once problems are defined, AI can do a reasonably good job at ‚Äúwriting the code‚Äù that solves the problem. 
* Verification: AI can verify if the code is correct. 
* Ownership: AI cannot take ownership. Nor can AI suffer for for mistakes or illegal behaviour. You can‚Äôt prosecute an AI.

We see how AI affects the task as a whole. AI can do most of what a SWE does. If a organization does not give the software engineer the responsibility of defining problems, and taking ownership of the code, then an AI can perform almost all tasks involved in writing computer code.

AI affects the other tasks that a software engineer does in very similar ways. In summary, humans are needed for tasks that need intent, creativity, and ownership. AI can do all the rest.

So, will AI take your job?

It depends on the extent to which AI can take over tasks in your job, and how you might be able to make use of the time you save as a result. Here are a few scenarios.

* AI can do all your tasks. The you will lose job. For example, AI will replace low-quality software engineers. üò≠

* AI can do most of your tasks. Only you can perform the remaining tasks. Then you are going to be a more productive. You will be paid extra for that additional productivity. For example, AI could probably do 80% of the tasks that a high-quality software engineer does. But few can do the remaining 20%, which involves significant creativity and intent. As a result, high-quality software engineers can be five times more productive, and (in theory) get paid five times more. üòÄ

* If AI can do most of the tasks, and many humans can do the remaining tasks, then you are likely to keep your job, but you will be paid less. For example, a mid-range SWE, who doesn‚Äôt contribute much on the creativity and intent front, but is relied upon on the ownership front, will now have only 20% of the workload they had. As a result, a software company would need only 1 SWE, when it previously needed five. The addition of supply in the market will push down salaries. ü´§

Extending this reasoning more generally to all jobs, we could summarize as follows.

* üòÄ AI will be very good news for high-end jobs involving creativity and intent.
* ü´§ AI will be bad news for mid-range jobs, which have little creativity and intent, but still have some ownership
* üò≠AI will destroy low-end jobs, which have neither creativity, nor intent, nor ownership. If you fall into this group, you should be very worried.
